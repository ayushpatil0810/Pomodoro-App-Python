# Pomodoro App

This Pomodoro App is a simple time management tool built with Python and Tkinter. It follows the Pomodoro Technique, alternating between work sessions (25 minutes) and breaks (5 or 20 minutes) to improve focus and productivity. The app features an easy-to-use interface with a visual countdown, automatic session transitions, and progress tracking using checkmarks. Perfect for students, professionals, and anyone looking to boost productivity! ðŸš€

- **Work & Break Intervals:** 25-minute work sessions, 5-minute short breaks, and a 20-minute long break after every four work sessions.
- **Visual Timer Display:** A digital countdown timer displayed inside a tomato image.
